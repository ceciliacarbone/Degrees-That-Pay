# Degrees-That-Pay
This Rshiny application will show information on a data set that shows the relationship between undergraduate major and salary after graduation. This application can be used as a tool to help determine a major and understand the salary outcome and range. This data was obtained from Kaggle.comn and all data was obtained from the Wall Street Journal based on data from Payscale, Inc.
